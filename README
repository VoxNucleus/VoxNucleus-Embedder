# How does it work?

embedder-equivalence : this is the file you want to modify to add more options. Warning please respect the format.
Only this format is accepted :
key;{params}.;embedded code;NEWLINE

This software relies on the power of yaws server. I invite you to go and do some research on the performance of yaws server.
The code is divided into logical units. The different files will be renamed in the future (lack of coherence)


# Future improvements

- In the future instead of stocking the data into a file, the content of the file will be sent to a database (very probably mnesis since it is included in Erlang) 
- Add options to remotely add/ delete options
- Add possibility to see the list of equivalence
- More advanced Javascript client
- More robust code (try-catch)
