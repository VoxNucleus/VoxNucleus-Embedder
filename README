## License : GPL
## State  :  working (early beta)
## Programming Language : 100% Erlang

## Dependency : Yaws webserver

## How does it work?

### WARNING MASTER IS IN V0.2 and v0.2 is in v0.1 (sorry about that)

embedder-equivalence : this is the file you want to modify to add more options. Warning please respect the format.
Only this format is accepted :
key;{parameters}.;{defaultvalues};embedded code;NEWLINE

The first of the parameters indicates to the embedder how to find the 

This software relies on the power of yaws server. I invite you to go and do some research on the performance of yaws server.
The code is divided into logical units. The different files will be renamed in the future (lack of coherence)

## Configuration

#Installation

1. Have erlang installed
2. Download Yaws Server ( http://yaws.hyber.org/ )
3. Unzip / put the files in a folder and respect the folder organization
4. Put yaws server at the root folder of Erlembedder under ./web-server/yaws
5. If ./ebin/ is empty run make.sh $./make.sh is fine
6. Launch Erlembedder with start-embedder.sh $./start-embedder.sh

7. Do your own client or use the javascript client and configure apache / yaws etc... according to your client needs
8. Enjoy


#Yaws - Configuration

This is the first you want to modify. By default the server is embedded in the program (and it should be like that) but it uses a port that you can select.
The configuration of the server is in ./include/embedder.hrl

## Features

- Fast and simple association algorithm with no ties to other website's API.
- Start a separate server: if it crashes it won't affect the rest of the system
- Premade Javascript client to use on your website. Minimal to no need to change your website.
- Easy to use and expand system

## Future improvements

- Add options to remotely add/ delete options (from the javascript)
- Add more compatibility with exotic systems
- Add a universall bbcode-like such as : <a vn_emb="[website.ext:videoid;option1:value1;option2:value2]"></a>

## Known bugs and problems

-Some incompatibilities (listed below)
-Issues with Yaws dying on windows at startup.
-When using the "slash" method if you need to consider the last slashed element and there is a parameter (&parameter=something) or id such as (#id) it will fail.
-When using several links videos (like in the example) when clicking different links it will not close the previous videos.
- Websites which add things like # in the end of their address or parameters make the embedding process fail (considers the things as part of the key)

##Compatibility "out of the box"(more to be added)
